Random thoughts...

- Refactor opengl stuff into separate 'rendering' class
- init/setup - accept a list of provinces (which contain vertices to set up),
  do all world map
  vertices in dictionary? (tuple like?) Bah, want Python!
- drawControl(provinces, colour), drawIncognito(provinces)
- methods: world map, + 'draw provinces'
